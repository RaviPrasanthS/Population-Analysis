#Project Overview
            This project involves analyzing population data using SQL and Python and visualizing it using Power BI. 
The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and exploration to derive insights from population trends over different years, age groups, and genders. 
Population datasets are essential for governmental urban planning, healthcare service forecasting, educational resource allocation, market analysis by businesses, 
infrastructure planning, social program design by NGOs, demographic studies by researchers, and various applications by investors, utility companies, transportation authorities, and real estate developers.
###Methodology:
SQL Queries: I standardized and broadened age group categories, updated age values, and added an age category column. I also calculated the total population and identified key trends.
Power BI: Accessed the dataset from Microsoft SQL Server Studio and performed data visualization using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and other features for creating dashboards and reports.
Python Data Analysis: Loaded, cleaned, and transformed data using Pandas, merged datasets, created new features like age categories, and exported cleaned data.
Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations including total population by region, population trends over time, distribution across age categories, 
and correlation analysis between male and female populations.
###Conclusion
The project combined SQL for data cleaning and aggregation with Python for analysis and visualization, offering insights valuable for policymakers, researchers, and analysts across sectors. 
Population data aids decision-making in urban planning, healthcare service forecasting, resource allocation, and targeted marketing, enhancing service delivery and resource management efficiency.
